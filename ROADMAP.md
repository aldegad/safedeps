# Safedeps Roadmap

> Timeline and priorities. The **why / how** lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md); the **when / what first** lives here. *(한국어 → [ROADMAP.ko.md](./ROADMAP.ko.md))*

---

## Scope

Safedeps gates **development dependency installs** (npm / pip / cargo / go / gem / maven / nuget). At release time it also runs a repo-tree secret scan, dependency audit, and git-hook install/check (the lane absorbed from the former `security-release-gates`).

Out of scope: OS / system packages, container images, runtime sandboxing, registry integrity, and reputation analysis. Those are different security layers and stay in different tools — see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §1 for the boundary.

---

## v1 — `npm-reorg-guard` (shipped)

- npm-only, self-contained, no external advisory database.
- PreToolUse hook: typosquat / `curl | bash` / non-standard registry pattern blocks.
- PostToolUse hook: lockfile diff + install-script analysis → reorg (rollback) on suspicion.

Limits: npm only, no CVE lookup (pattern matching), evadable by a determined adversary. The GitHub repo has since been renamed `aldegad/safedeps`.

---

## v2 — `safedeps` (shipped, v2.1.x)

The internal engine keeps the v1 `reorg-guard` assets.

### What changed

- **Multi-ecosystem**: npm / yarn / pnpm / pip (poetry, uv, pipenv) / cargo / go / gem / maven / nuget.
- **External advisory databases**: OSV.dev (canonical) + CISA KEV (hard-risk overlay) + GitHub Advisory (enrichment).
- **Three-phase defense**:
  1. Advisory gate (`safedeps check`) — query the advisory databases before the install command is written, decide a safe spec, and record it to the `~/.safedeps/approved-specs/` ledger.
  2. Hook enforcement (`safedeps-pre-guard.sh`) — verify the install matches the ledger.
  3. Post-install reorg (`safedeps-post-verify.sh`) — the v1 engine, rolling back on divergence.
- **Approved-spec TTL** (30 days) + **daily re-check** (revoke + alert when a new CVE appears).
- **No silent fallback**: a provider failure is fail-closed; any override is explicit and observable.

### Milestones (all shipped)

| Milestone | Output |
|---|---|
| `v2.0-doc` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` v2 written and pushed. |
| `v2.1-rename` | Repo / skill id / paths renamed to `safedeps`; `safedeps migrate` moves legacy `~/.npm-reorg-guard` state to `~/.safedeps` and cleans up legacy hooks. |
| `v2.1-providers` | `lib/providers/` — OSV / KEV / GHSA adapters behind one query interface, with a 24h response cache. |
| `v2.1-ledger` | `lib/ledger/` — approved-spec JSON I/O (atomic write, hash, TTL check). |
| `v2.1-cli` | `bin/safedeps` — `check`, `ledger`, `revoke`, `re-check`, `migrate`, `version` subcommands. |
| `v2.1-guard-patch` | `safedeps-pre-guard.sh` — ledger enforcement on top of the v1 pattern blocks. |
| `v2.1-verify-patch` | `safedeps-post-verify.sh` — lockfile-diff comparison against the approved spec on top of the v1 reorg. |
| `v2.1-multi-ecosystem` | pip / cargo / go / gem / maven / nuget command parsing + lockfile snapshots, shared as rollback truth across both hooks. |
| `v2.1-hook-rename` | Hook file namespacing + cross-engine installer (`install-safedeps-hooks.mjs`, idempotent, `--uninstall`). |
| `v2.1-recheck-cron` | Daily re-check LaunchAgent — re-queries every approved spec, revokes + notifies on new CVE/KEV/provider-skip. |
| `v2.1-tests` | End-to-end tests — fixture provider responses drive ledger / hook / re-check / migration checks. |
| `v2.1-release` | npm publish (`@aldegad/safedeps`) + GitHub release. |

### Release notes

- The npm package version in `package.json` is the single source of truth. `bin/safedeps` `SAFEDEPS_VERSION` tracks it and the smoke test reads `package.json` to compare (current: v2.1.1).
- `npm test` runs the release smoke suite; the full fixture E2E lives under `v2.1-tests`.
- The daily re-check uses no LLM tokens. It is opt-in: a macOS `launchd` user agent runs `safedeps re-check --json` daily, installed atomically by `install-safedeps-recheck-agent.mjs`. It writes `~/.safedeps/recheck.log` and `~/.safedeps/recheck-alerts.jsonl` and raises a macOS notification on a new CVE/KEV/revoke/provider-skip. Network is used only for OSV / CISA / GHSA queries.

## v2.2 — effect-based enforcement (npm prototype)

Status: implemented as the npm-first prototype.

### What changed

- **Authority moved to effects**: PostToolUse now reads the actual `package-lock.json` closure and compares every installed `pkg@version` against approved direct specs plus their `transitive_specs`.
- **Full closure approval for npm**: `safedeps check npm <pkg>@<version>` resolves a script-free lockfile in a temp dir with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`, extracts the full closure, and queries OSV `/v1/querybatch`.
- **Batch + cache**: OSV batch responses are written back into the same per `pkg@version` 24h cache used by single-package provider queries.
- **No blind trust for transitives**: a clean direct package with an unapproved or vulnerable transitive dependency is not enough; the full closure must be clean and recorded.
- **PreToolUse demoted to fast UX guard**: command parsing still blocks obvious unapproved install attempts and keeps the bypass regression coverage, but PostToolUse is the primary enforcement surface.

### npm-only boundary

This phase covers npm lockfile closure only. pip / cargo / go / gem / maven / nuget keep the v2.1 command/ledger/reorg behavior until each ecosystem has an explicit closure resolver and script/no-execution policy.

### Verification

- closure approval records `transitive_specs`
- unapproved transitive package in `package-lock.json` triggers post-verify reorg
- approved full-closure install passes without false reorg
- heredoc / echo text does not trigger install detection
- existing smoke + fixture E2E regression suite remains green

### Current focus

1. `v2.1-release`: commit / tag / GitHub release / npm publish.

## v3 (future)

### Ledger tamper resistance

Defends the second-order attack where a malicious package's `postinstall` (running as the user) forges a "B approved" ledger entry so a later install of B skips the advisory check. The package cannot do this *before* it runs, so closing the install-time gate is the first line of defense; this hardens the case where a first compromise already happened.

Approach — **treat OSV as the authority and the ledger as a cache**, plus tamper detection. Cheap, layers onto existing infra:

1. **Re-validate at enforcement / re-check** — verify the stored evidence against OSV instead of trusting the ledger verdict. A forged entry with no real evidence (or for a package OSV reports as vulnerable) is caught and revoked. Reduces the ledger to memoization with OSV as SSoT.
2. **Watch `~/.safedeps/` in the post-install scan** — the post-verify hook already flags `postinstall` scripts that touch `~/.ssh` / `.env`; add `~/.safedeps/` so a package that writes the ledger trips a reorg — catching the forge in the act.
3. **Provenance cross-check in daily re-check** — flag ledger entries with no matching `advisory.log` record (i.e. no real `safedeps check` ever ran) as suspected forgeries.

Explicit non-approach: **cryptographic ledger signing is not pursued** — a same-uid attacker can read the signing key and re-sign forgeries, so a local HMAC/signature adds no real boundary. The defense is authority-elsewhere (OSV) + detection, not local secrets.

### Other v3 work

- **Plugin providers** — user-defined advisory sources (internal vuln DB, private registry).
- **Policy file** — `.safedeps.toml` for team policy (auto-block on KEV hit, user confirm on CVSS 7+, per-package allowlist).
- **CI mode** — `safedeps check --ci` for fail-fast in GitHub Actions / CircleCI.
- **Closure expansion beyond npm** — pip / cargo / go / gem / maven / nuget closure resolvers with explicit no-script/no-build policies.
- **Transitive risk score** — deps.dev graph integration; risk visualization beyond direct dependencies.

## v4+ (long-term)

- **Team-shared ledger** — multi-machine approved-spec sync.
- **Agent remediation** — Claude / Codex suggests a safer replacement when a vuln is found (LLM-as-judge).
- **Diff visualization** — dependency-tree diff between two approved-spec snapshots.
